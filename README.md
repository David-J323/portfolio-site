This is a portfolio site for my graphic design work.
The nav bar is fixed at the top for all viewports (mobile has a hamburger menu).
Button prompts and images allow the user to access other pages.  
The site is currently being updated as more and more projects are uploaded. 
This site was built using Bootstrap 4, SASS, CSS3, and HTML5. 

Future changes to considered: 


- Adding a live feed from my instagram 

- Adding animation events for loading the pages, user interactions, etc...

- Adding custom form error events
